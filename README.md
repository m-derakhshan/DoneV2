# Done V2
> This is second and enhanced version of my previous todo application, Done.

After the first version of my todo application, it was used by more than 100 people, and honestly, I even didn't imagine anyone installing it. So now, I'm considering improving
the previous version and implementing it from scratch. There is going to be lots of feature in the new version. So, *WAIT FOR IT*!


## What I use in project:
below is list of some tools and technologies that I'm going to use:

    1) MVVM architecture
    2) Clearn Architecture
    3) Dagger Hilt
    4) Room persistance library
    5) *jetpack compose* ( YES! it is going to be entirely based on Jetpack compose)
    6) Firebase Authentication
    7) Firebase Firestore
    8)...

## Project Structure
